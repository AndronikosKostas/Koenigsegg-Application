# KoenigseggApplication

## Q1
The solution is to the application.c file.

## Q2
If we used only PWM control, it would be open-loop and we would have a lot of issues to deal with. What sounds reasonable to me is to add a PWM after the controller and then send the output to the mechanism.

## Q3
Folder structure ? What do you mean by that?

## Q4
Rear wing controll, automatic and remote opening and closing of the doors, boot and engine lid. I cannot come up with new ideas, before I fully understand the previous designs, but I am very familiar with developing software from scratch as all my previous projects was started and finished entirely from me.

## Q5
### Regera
The Regera's internal combustion engine is a twin-turbocharged V8 that produces over 1,100 horsepower. This engine is coupled to a hydraulic coupling and a single-speed transmission. The hydraulic coupling allows the engine to be decoupled from the transmission when it is not needed, such as when the car is traveling at low speeds or when the electric motors can provide sufficient power on their own.
### Jesko Light Speed Transmission
Multi-plate clutch: The multi-plate clutch in the Jesko Light Speed Transmission is designed to allow the car to rapidly shift gears while maintaining a high level of torque. This helps to improve the car's acceleration and overall performance. Hydraulic actuation system: The hydraulic actuation system in the Jesko Light Speed Transmission is used to smoothly and quickly shift gears. It uses pressurized oil to actuate the gears and ensure that they are engaged properly.
### CC850
As for the legendary CC850 which is the reinvention of the manual transmission but also keep the the nine speed automatic transmission gearbox. So basically when it is in auto mode it uses 9 gear and for its gear it has 2 cluthes. For instance, for the first gear we have clutch 1 and 4, for the second gear we have clutch 1 and 5 etc. Now if we take the gear selector to the manual selection region, we are in manual mode and we have 6 available gears. All the magic in the manual is that the release of the left pedal controls the engangement of the second clutch.
