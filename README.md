## Q5
### Regera
The Regera's internal combustion engine is a twin-turbocharged V8 that produces over 1,100 horsepower. This engine is coupled to a hydraulic coupling and a single-speed transmission. The hydraulic coupling allows the engine to be decoupled from the transmission when it is not needed, such as when the car is traveling at low speeds or when the electric motors can provide sufficient power on their own.
### Jesko Light Speed Transmission
Multi-plate clutch: The multi-plate clutch in the Jesko Light Speed Transmission is designed to allow the car to rapidly shift gears while maintaining a high level of torque. This helps to improve the car's acceleration and overall performance. Hydraulic actuation system: The hydraulic actuation system in the Jesko Light Speed Transmission is used to smoothly and quickly shift gears. It uses pressurized oil to actuate the gears and ensure that they are engaged properly.
