# KoenigseggApplication

## Q1
The solution is to the application.c file. Regarding the handling of fine installation tolerances, I would tweak the gains through simulations and I would use some HF filters to keep the output even more smoother.

## Q2
If we used only PWM control, it would be open-loop and we would have a lot of issues to deal with. What sounds reasonable to me is to add a PWM after the controller and then send the output to the mechanism.

## Q3
Folder structure ? What do you mean by that?

## Q4
Rear wing control, automatic and remote opening and closing of the doors, boot and engine lid. I cannot come up with new ideas, before I fully understand the previous designs, but I am very familiar with developing software from scratch as all my previous projects was started and finished entirely from me.

## Q5
### Regera
The Regera's internal combustion engine is a twin-turbocharged V8 that produces over 1,100 horsepower. This engine is coupled to a hydraulic coupling and a single-speed transmission. The hydraulic coupling allows the engine to be decoupled from the transmission when it is not needed, such as when the car is traveling at low speeds or when the electric motors can provide sufficient power on their own.
### Jesko Light Speed Transmission
In the Jesko Light Speed Transmission we have the multi-plate clutch that is designed to allow the car to rapidly shift gears while maintaining a high level of torque. This helps to improve the car's acceleration and overall performance. It has a hydraulic actuation system that uses pressurized oil to actuate the gears and ensure that they are engaged properly.
### CC850
The legendary CC850 which combines a 6-speed transmission manual gearbox with a 9-speed automatic gearbox all in one. When the driver selects the automatic each gear uses two clutches. For instance, for the first gear it uses clutch 1 and 4, for the second gear we have clutch 1 and 5 etc. Now, in manual is that the release of the left pedal controls the engangement of the second clutch and that is the magic which geaves to the driver the feeling of the manual.
